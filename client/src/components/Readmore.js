        <h3>Types</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Allogeneic stem cell transplant</li>
            <li>2. Autologous stem cell transplant</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Why it's done </h2>

        A bone marrow transplant may be used to:
        Safely allow treatment of your condition with high doses of chemotherapy or radiation by replacing or rescuing
        the
        bone marrow damaged by treatment
        Replace diseased or damaged marrow with new stem cells
        Provide new stem cells, which can help kill cancer cells directly<br />
        Bone marrow transplants can benefit people with a variety of both cancerous (malignant) and noncancerous
        (benign)
        diseases, including:
        <ul>
            <li>1. Acute leukemia</li>
            <li>2. Adrenoleukodystrophy</li>
            <li>3. Aplastic anemia</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Risks</h3>
        A bone marrow transplant poses numerous risks. Some people experience minimal problems with a bone marrow
        transplant, while others can have serious complications that require treatment or hospitalization. Sometimes,
        complications are life-threatening.
        Your particular risks depend on many factors, including the disease or condition that caused you to need a
        transplant, the type of transplant, and your age and overall health.<br />
        Possible complications from a bone marrow transplant include:
        <ul>
            <li>1. Graft-versus-host disease (allogeneic transplant only)</li>
            <li>2. Stem cell (graft) failure</li>
            <li>3. Organ damage</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How does an AUTO transplant work?</h3><br />
        <b>Step 1:</b> Collecting your stem cells. This step takes several days. First, you will get injections (shots)
        of a
        medication to increase your stem cells. Then your health care team collects the stem cells through a vein in
        your arm or your chest. The cells will be stored until they are needed.<br />
        <b>Step 2:</b> Pre-transplant treatment. This step takes 5 to 10 days. You will get a high dose of chemotherapy.
        Occasionally, patients also have radiation therapy.<br />
        <b>Step 3: </b>Getting your stem cells back. This step is your transplant day. It takes about 30 minutes for
        each dose
        of stem cells. This is called an infusion. Your health care team puts the stem cells back into your bloodstream
        through the catheter. You might have more than one infusion.<br />
        <b>Step 4:</b> Recovery. Your doctor will closely monitor your cells' recovery and growth and you will take
        antibiotics
        to reduce infection. Your health care team will also treat any side effects. Read more details below about
        recovering from a bone marrow transplant.<br />
